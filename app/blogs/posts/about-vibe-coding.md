# Introduction

As you may now know, In today's social media trends of programming and much more, Vibe coding refers
to the use of A.I (Artificial Intelligence) in coding. But is it really helpful or that good?

First off, my experience towards using A.I in coding is a 50/50, most of the time A.I models like Chatgpt, Gemini & Claude (which I sometimes use) can get wrong in coding a specific task. Most of the time as well, according to benchmarks and other developers experience, most of Chatgpt code is pure dogwater and unnecessary and are sometimes out of context.

## Vibe Coding

But let's also talk about Claude, why is it also *mostly* used by Vibe Coders.

Claude, used by most developers, has been receiving good benchmarks for the months or weeks. Its ability to code well for developers has been stunning, yet surprising by others.

Other websites like Bolt, v0, and more are increasingly being used by newbie front-end developers or
even full stack developers. 

IDE's like Cursor, PearAI and VSCode Github Copilot are now in a high demand for its ability to use
A.I efficiently~ish.

But does using A.I all the time and relying on it always a good thing? Again, **No**.

Most developers, including me need to realize for themselves that A.I is just a tool, not a whole replacement for coding.

A.I models are trained with limited data, which might mostly mess up your codebase depending on a framework, software or languages update, it'll *hallucinates* itself and maybe run into a loop, which is annoying, Duh.

## Conclusion

Overall, A.I may be great as a tooling or a little guide for your journey of programming, but
again and again try to not always get intact or always rely on it. I have done that before, and I'm not sure if I'll do it again, well.. Probably wont since I learned my lesson.

Anyways, learn independently, read documentations, ask questions, and try to learn from others.
Thank you!
